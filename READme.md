A technology that where the source port chosen by the client is same as router uses is called port preservation.
A technology where specific destination ports can be configured to always deliver data on specific nodes is called port forwarding.
A fully qualified Domain name consists of the parts. First is the sub domain e.g wwww or mail. The next part is domain name e.g google microdoft. and the last is Top level domain e.g com.
DNS is used to convert the domain name into the ip adderess. In practice DNS works with some record files or resources. The are different resource records e.g A record, mail record etc.
An A record is used to point at a certain ip like 10.1.1.10. CNMAE record is used to assign differnt subdomains to a certain ip addresses. Pointer record is used to convert ip address to a 
domain name. Name server record has all the info about the DNS or it the database of DNS. DNS uses UDP port 53 for name resolution.
A DHCP dynamically assigns ip address to each device on a LAN network. since the connecting device has no ip address so a a special message is formed with 0.0.0.0 it is then sent to every
node on the network with a broadcast message of 255.255.255.255. The DHCP server knows that is was intended for it so sends an ack message with a broadcast message to the network .The host 
compuetr knows that it was intended for it so it accpets the offer and then the dhcp server sends an ip addreess with a lease. the dhcp server can automatically assign the same ip to the 
same  machine if it is  not in use.
A technology that allows for the extension of local or private network to the clients that are not physically present on that network. it uses the tunnling protocol. it is usually a secure
way to access the outside world to hide our ip.  
A proxy serves as a server between client and the outside world. webproxies usually hold the web pages in their database which are mostly visited but this prox
NAT is technology where the public ip address of the devices is hided by the router so the router sends its own default gatways address as an ip address of the device. it can be used to 
block traffic to certain websites.  
plain old switching network is an old tephone system.USENET was used to share information across computers on a short distance.
this technology uses modem which stands for Modulating/demodulating. it gets computer digital data, convets it into analogue signal and sends through copper wires of telephone.
then this data was sent to telephone exchange from where it was sent to the other copmuter.
