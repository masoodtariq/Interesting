A technology that where the source port chosen by the client is same as router uses is called port preservation.
A technology where specific destination ports can be configured to always deliver data on specific nodes is called port forwarding.
A fully qualified Domain name consists of the parts. First is the sub domain e.g wwww or mail. The next part is domain name e.g google microdoft. and the last is Top level domain e.g com.
DNS is used to convert the domain name into the ip adderess. In practice DNS works with some record files or resources. The are different resource records e.g A record, mail record etc.
An A record is used to point at a certain ip like 10.1.1.10. CNMAE record is used to assign differnt subdomains to a certain ip addresses. Pointer record is used to convert ip address to a 
domain name. Name server record has all the info about the DNS or it the database of DNS. DNS uses UDP port 53 for name resolution.
A DHCP dynamically assigns ip address to each device on a LAN network. since the connecting device has no ip address so a a special message is formed with 0.0.0.0 it is then sent to every
node on the network with a broadcast message of 255.255.255.255. The DHCP server knows that is was intended for it so sends an ack message with a broadcast message to the network .The host 
compuetr knows that it was intended for it so it accpets the offer and then the dhcp server sends an ip addreess with a lease. the dhcp server can automatically assign the same ip to the 
same  machine if it is  not in use.
A technology that allows for the extension of local or private network to the clients that are not physically present on that network. it uses the tunnling protocol. it is usually a secure
way to access the outside world to hide our ip.  
A proxy serves as a server between client and the outside world. webproxies usually hold the web pages in their database which are mostly visited but this prox
NAT is technology where the public ip address of the devices is hided by the router so the router sends its own default gatways address as an ip address of the device. it can be used to 
block traffic to certain websites.

plain old switching network is an old tephone system.USENET was used to share information across computers on a short distance.
the technology used is called USENET that uses modem which stands for Modulating/demodulating. it gets computer digital data, convets it into analogue signal and sends through copper wires of telephone.
then this data was sent to telephone exchange from where it was sent to the other copmuter. 
Broadband means fast. In netwoking technology it is reffered to something that is faster that old dial up connections. Broadband technology uses the links thar are always on.Broadband has 
shaped todays world. These are long distance connections that you dont always need to establish for each use.
T-technolgies are invented by AT&T. In this technology uses a single wire to tansfer 24 calls at time. Later this technology was used to tansfer data with 64kb*24 on each single wire which
is roughly equal to 1.5Mbps. 
In DSL,Digital Subscriber line, telephone wires usually copper are used to share data. The bandwidth is indiviual for each consumer. There are two types of speed. In asymmetric DSL,
Downloading speed is faster that uploading while in symmetric DSL both  uploading and downloading speeds are different. a router or modem known as DSLAM or digital subsriber line access
modem. The connection vanishes when DSLAM is powered off.
In cable connections usually TV cables are used by varying the frequency in a way that it does not disturb the tv tansmission. The bandwidth is shared that why when the using rate is high,
it can make the connections slow.earlier COs or central offices were used which basically connects the cable networks to the telephone central offices to provide them their purchased
bandwidth but now they can perform this task automatically. The cable modem sits at customer end to  connect it to cable modem termination system which connects a lot of networks to ISPs
core network system.
In fibre connections fibre technology is used. The are different types like FTTX. X can vary from from ISP to ISP.FTTN means fibre to the neighbouhood.
This means that fiber technologies are used to deliver data to a single physical cabinet that serves a certain amount of the population. From this cabinet, twisted pair copper or coax might
be used for the last length of distance..FTTB means fibre fibre to the bulding(usually a big building like 
residential buildings) from where it is sent through wires for the usage. FTTH means fibre to the home which is dirctly connected t the home FTTB and FTTH can also be reffered as FTTP or 
fibre to the premises. 
In WAN or wide area network you usually creates your own local network at particular physical locatiob but if you have another office in another location then instead of building another
setup you make a contract with the ISP to share your services to another office. the region between these two loation is called local hoop. 
In wireless technology we uses 802.11 standars or protocols for wireless communication. We use a specific frequency band for communication of radio waves. Internet access point is basically
a bridge between wireless and wired connection. The difference between a router and a Wireless AP is that you can only access wireless communication with Wireless AP but with router you
can even make wired and wireless communication. If we have a lot of routers then we need to configure every router but if we use WAP we just have to configure only one router and connect
every WAP to it. we can use mesh network to connect routers and WAP becuase in mesh every wap is connect to other wap and we dont need much wires to connect every router with wap.
WPA cant provide IP addresses so you will take IP through router. Two factor authentication is way where more that username or passwords is required.
In ad-hoc networks every device or node is connected to the other without any gateway or router e.g connecting differnt devices through bluetooth. In WLAN networks devices uses a router
 or modem to share the data. Wireless security can be done through an flawful encryption method called WEP or wired euivalent privacy. you can also use mac filtering to allow specific
devices to connect to your router.
